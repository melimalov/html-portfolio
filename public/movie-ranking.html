<h1>The Best Animated Movies According to Meli</h1>
<h2> My top 3 animated movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>One of the best animated movies I have ever watched, the characters and animations inspired me so much</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>I just believe this is one of those sophisticated films that make you laugh and will go down in history as one of the best</p>
<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>This is just that perfect movie directed by Tim Burton that hits me in the feels with the awesome musical tones and a balance between Halloween-y and Christmas-sy vibes</p>
